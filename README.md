## Build a TODO app with jQuery

### Requirements:
* Node.js installed on your computer

### Setup:

```sh
npm install
```

### Getting started:

The following command will start the server and the client. Your browser will automatically open. The browser will automatically refresh each time you save a file.

```sh
npm start

The _only_ files you need to modify are in the client folder. No need to touch the server folder.

* [ ] POST new todo when create button is clicked
* [ ] GET all todos, add them to page
